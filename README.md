# Project Overview

In this project, I have meticulously crafted a cricket dashboard designed to showcase comprehensive player statistics. The primary objective is to offer a detailed analysis of each player's performance through visually appealing data visualizations.

# Data Extraction

The data retrieval process involves utilizing Python with a focus on the following libraries: Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and Pandas. By leveraging these, I have seamlessly extracted data from ESPNcricinfo, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the information presented.

# Structure

The project is organized into distinct components encapsulated within four individual Python files, each file serves as a dedicated module. A central Main.py file has been created. Within this file, the individual functions are invoked to retrieve the relevant data for each player. The resulting dataset serves as the foundation for constructing an insightful cricket dashboard.

# Dashboard

 The extracted data is then loaded into Power BI to create visually appealing visualization which provides a comprehensive view of each player's performance.
